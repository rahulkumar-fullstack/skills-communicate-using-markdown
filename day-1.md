# Day 1

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 1 of our Markdown journey! In this file, we will explore the **basics** of Markdown formatting.

## Key Features

### 1. Text Formatting
- **Bold Text**: Use `**` for bold text.
- _Italic Text_: Use `_` or `*` for italic text.
- `Code Formatting`: Use backticks to format code snippets.

### 2. Creating Lists
- Unordered lists are created by using `-`, `*`, or `+`.
- Ordered lists are created by using numbers followed by a period, like `1. Item`

### 3. Blockquotes
> Blockquotes are a way to highlight important information.

For example, you could say:
> "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today." - Franklin D. Roosevelt

### 4. Links and Images
- **Links**: Use `[link text](URL)` to create hyperlinks.
- **Images**: Use `![alt text](image URL)` to add images.

## Conclusion
Markdown is a powerful tool for formatting text easily and efficiently. With these features, you can create rich documents with minimal effort!
